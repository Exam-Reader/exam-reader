## Description

This is the mobile interface of an exam reader application written with React Native. While the screen interfaces are fully developed, the server connection is currently only available for the login and register pages.

In the future, we plan to integrate image processing and server connections, and offer the application once again with these additional features.

### The Packages That I Use In The Program

Below are some packages that may be useful for future use:

**[react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/ "react-navigation"):** When it comes to navigating between screens, there is one library that stands out as the most popular and useful. In this application, I used several navigation examples, including stack, bottom bar, and drawer navigation, all made possible thanks to this powerful library.

**[react-native-elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/docs "react-native-elements"):** In this package, we are provided with some components such as buttons and inputs, along with some useful features.

**[react-native-gesture-handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-gesture-handler "react-native-gesture-handler"):** This package enabled me to use animations, making touches and screen transitions smoother and more visually pleasing.

**[react-native-modal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-modal "react-native-modal"):** Thanks to this package, I was able to easily create pop-up windows and make my application more interactive.

**[react-native-bottom-sheet](https://gorhom.github.io/react-native-bottom-sheet/ "react-native-bottom-sheet"):** Thanks to this library, I was able to add a bottom sheet component to my application. This allowed me to hide certain information under the screen, which might have been useless from a UX standpoint if displayed on the main screen.

**[react-native-popover-view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-popover-view "react-native-popover-view"):** With this package, I was able to generate components that can be associated with and displayed immediately next to the component that clicked on. This also helped me make improvements in the UX of my application.

**[react-native-reanimated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-reanimated "react-native-reanimated"):** This library provides an API for both animations that come from different libraries and animations that we can create ourselves.

**[react-native-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-svg "react-native-svg"):** This package is necessary because it enables the use of SVG images within React Native.
